Description: Tools for analysing OTU/ASV/MAG diversity based on Hill numbers.
  'hilldiv2' is an R package that provides a set of functions to assist analysis of diversity for
  diet reconstruction, microbial community profiling or more general ecosystem characterisation
  analyses based on Hill numbers, using OTU/ASV/MAG tables and associated phylogenetic trees and/or trait tables as
  inputs. The package includes functions for neutral, phylogenetic and functional diversity measurement, diversity
  partitioning and dissimilarity measurement. All of these based on Hill numbers.
  The statistical framework developed around Hill numbers encompasses many of the most
  broadly employed diversity (e.g. richness, Shannon index, Simpson index),
  phylogenetic diversity (e.g. Faith's PD, Allen's H, Rao's quadratic entropy) and
  dissimilarity (e.g. Sorensen index, Unifrac distances) metrics. This enables the most
  common analyses of diversity to be performed while grounded in a single statistical
  framework. The methods are described in Jost et al. (2007) <DOI:10.1890/06-1736.1>,
  Chao et al. (2010) <DOI:10.1098/rstb.2010.0272> and Chiu et al. (2014)
  <DOI:10.1890/12-0960.1>; and reviewed in the framework of molecularly characterised
  biological systems in Alberdi & Gilbert (2019) <DOI:10.1111/1755-0998.13014>.
